* New keyboards only got me so far
* Got frustrated feeling limited

While taking four aleve a day, using a very specialized keyboard, adding a left-hand mouse, maintaining a stretching schedule, i could type ~3 hours a day with no more than ~30-45 straight minutes of typing, but broken up with long breaks in between.

* Started looking at voice dictation

Each letter of the alphabet is a word. The alphabet words are carefully chosen to have few syllables (for speed), and carefully chosen phonemes* (for accuracy).

## Learning Curve

it is steep ðŸ“ˆ

<!-- substantial ðŸ¤”ðŸ“š -->

## Not So Big Challenges

Supporting specific programming languages

???
- language optimizations are nice to have, quality of life improvements but not necessarily required
---
class: pain

## Voice Dictation Friendly Code
* Use abbreviations/acronyms thoughtfully
* Don't try to save vowels
  * \`backspace\` not \`bkspc\`
* shorter files are better

???
- use full words when you can (don't make it about english only)
- also benefits screen readers
---
class: painvert, middle, center
So... Why.

---
class: pain
## Take Aways
* Take care of your body!
* People are using speech to code in real life
* Remember non-keyboard users when building things :)
* The future may be more diverse than the keyboard/mouse model

???
- ask for ergo evaluations
