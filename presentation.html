* New keyboards only got me so far
* Got frustrated feeling limited

While taking four aleve a day, using a very specialized keyboard, adding a left-hand mouse, maintaining a stretching schedule, i could type ~3 hours a day with no more than ~30-45 straight minutes of typing, but broken up with long breaks in between.

* Started looking at voice dictation

## What Is Talon?
* Hands-free input
* Uses Dragon Dictation API
* Programmatically configured with Python
* Free!
* https://www.patreon.com/lunixbochs

???
Software that allows you to use hands free input to interact with your computer
it's very new (2018), and currently only mac
* (voice/noise commands, eye tracking)
free, but patreon support

This talk is not about Talon... it's an example of how Talon can be used. All 
the commands and tools you will see are built on top of Talon's API.
* Mention what dragon is
* Also has a built-in voice engine

Each letter of the alphabet is a word. The alphabet words are carefully chosen to have few syllables (for speed), and carefully chosen phonemes* (for accuracy).

Challenges

---
class: pain, middle
## Learning Curve

it is steep ðŸ“ˆ

<!-- substantial ðŸ¤”ðŸ“š -->

???
* like learning a bespoke new keyboard, but it's using completely different parts of your body
* some conventions starting to form, but most people have bespoke setup
* exacerbated with injury
* different flow than typing
* shifts in team communication may help
  * async when possible
  * zoom
* personally have been doing some work to help make transition easier

## Tools With Poor Accessibility

* lots of good talks on the topic

## Not So Big Challenges

* Supporting specific programming languages
* Building tools with Talon

???
- language optimizations are nice to have, quality of life improvements but not necessarily required
- Talon's API has been easy to work with. I can make new tools on the fly. Once I save a file, it's live. I often am iterating on my tools as I work. I can even build bigger tools, like render webview helpers. It's pretty powerful, and I'm only scratching the surface.

## Voice Dictation Friendly Code
* Use abbreviations/acronyms thoughtfully
* Don't try to save vowels
  * \`backspace\` not \`bkspc\`
* shorter files are better

???
- Surprisingly not that much I've run into, but a few things that I think are good practice anyway:
- use full words when you can (don't make it about english only)
- also benefits screen readers
- don't unnecessarily shorten words, like removing vowels. You aren't saving that much, you risk someone later not knowing what it means, and it's more difficult for voice/screen reader users.
- I navigate by line number. Longer files means I have to say longer numbers. It's generally good to avoid long files anyway.

So... Why.

???
- pause - 
You've seen some tech today that you probably aren't familiar with, and maybe it's interesting or novel. But I would be doing a disservice if I didn't remind folks the impact that technology such as this can have for folks like myself who were otherwise potentially looking at a career ending (or most certainly career limiting) injuries or othwerwise unable to use a keyboard or mouse.

After about a year of a very unsustainable, painful, stressful, work and personal life (because remember i still have symptoms when i'm not working). At its worst, the pain and discomfort was so bad that I couldn't sit through a meal at a restaurant, or I would skip social gatherings because I wouldn't be able to focus. I wouldn't travel because I couldn't find comfort riding in a car or plane. I often had to lay on the floor just to be somewhat comfortable. This is all the very personal things I'm sharing, but I feel like it's important to shed light on the real human impact of this tech. I remember first day that I was able to stop working when I wanted to and not because of pain, and that felt like such a wonderful treat. This technology has given me access when I felt like the door was closing. This is why I'm using voice.

As a cool side benefit, I get to stand here today with all you folks to show off how cool it is to talk to a computer.

## Take Aways
* Take care of your body!
* People are using speech to code in real life
* Remember non-keyboard users when building things :)
* The future may be more diverse than the keyboard/mouse model

???
- take care of your body (and appreciate what it can do, while you're at it!)
- ask for ergo evaluations
- people are using voice to write code - this is happening now.
- remember your non-keyboard users when you build things, don't make the pad sanda sad.
- the future may be more diverse than the keyboard/mouse model. many of the folks who are currently taking advantage of this tech do so because of an injury or physical limitation, but I think we are well on our way to a future where the keyboard and mouse are not the input methods. already we are seeing the rise in voice assistants (siri, alexa), and some exciting new companies popping up with wearables that read signals in your nervous system to control a computer. We've been relying heavily on touch control, but maybe it's time we question and challenge it's limitations.
