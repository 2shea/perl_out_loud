* New keyboards only got me so far
* Got frustrated feeling limited

While taking four aleve a day, using a very specialized keyboard, adding a left-hand mouse, maintaining a stretching schedule, i could type ~3 hours a day with no more than ~30-45 straight minutes of typing, but broken up with long breaks in between.

* Started looking at voice dictation

* (voice/noise commands, eye tracking) 

This talk is not about Talon... it's an example of how Talon can be used. All 
the commands and tools you will see are built on top of Talon's API.
* Mention what dragon is
* Also has a built-in voice engine

Each letter of the alphabet is a word. The alphabet words are carefully chosen to have few syllables (for speed), and carefully chosen phonemes* (for accuracy).

## Not So Big Challenges

Supporting specific programming languages

???
- language optimizations are nice to have, quality of life improvements but not necessarily required
---
class: pain

## Voice Dictation Friendly Code
* Use abbreviations/acronyms thoughtfully
* Don't try to save vowels
  * \`backspace\` not \`bkspc\`
* shorter files are better

???
- use full words when you can (don't make it about english only)
- also benefits screen readers
---
class: painvert, middle, center
So... Why.

---
class: pain
## Take Aways
* Take care of your body!
* People are using speech to code in real life
* Remember non-keyboard users when building things :)
* The future may be more diverse than the keyboard/mouse model

???
- ask for ergo evaluations
