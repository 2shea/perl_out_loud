# RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury)

???
a condition in which the prolonged performance of repetitive actions, typically with the hands, causes pain or impairment of function in the tendons and muscles involved.

Since 2017
Lost typing ability
Both hands

# First I tried...
* Taking breaks
* Wrist braces at night
* Anti-inflammatories (lots!)
* Occupational/Physical Therapy
* Acupuncture
* Chiropractor
* Pain creams
* Stretching

# Ergonomics

???
Tape pens to my hands
Tape fingers together
Standing desk
Split keyboard

* New keyboards only got me so far
* Got frustrated feeling limited

While taking four aleve a day, using a very specialized keyboard, adding a left-hand mouse, maintaining a stretching schedule, i could type ~3 hours a day with no more than ~30-45 straight minutes of typing, but broken up with long breaks in between.

* Started looking at voice dictation

# The Tech

* Dragon Dictation 6 for Mac
* Talon
* Decent Microphone

---

# What Is Talon?
* Hands-free input (voice/noise command, eye tracking)
* Uses Dragon Dictation API
* Also has a built-in voice engine
* Configurable with Python
* Free!
* Ryan Hileman (the author)
* New in 2018

This talk is not about Talon... it's an example of how Talon can be used. All the commands and tools you will see are built on top of Talon's API.

Each letter of the alphabet is a word. The alphabet words are carefully chosen to have few syllables (for speed), and carefully chosen phonemes* (for accuracy).

# But what about all those symbols in perl?
### Actually, symbols are easy. 

---

### Knowing the alphabet, basic keys, and keyboard shortcuts will get you far

* "command cap" -> cmd + C -> Copy
* "command pit" -> cmd + P -> Paste
* "command space" -> cmd + Space -> Open Spotlight
* "command shift trap" -> cmd + shift + T -> Restore recently closed browser

#### For long or hard to remember combinations, I can configure commands in Talon

# Challenges
* ramp up with limited typing ability is HARD
* need to think ahead more before executing
* some things still require a mouse
* voice strain
* open office

# Voice Dictation Friendly Engineering
* Use abbreviations/acronyms thoughtfully
  * backspace not bkspc
* async communication
* zoom
* Build apps with accessibility consideration, lots of great talks about this!

---
Summary
* Take care of your body!
* Voice Dictation is surprisingly decent
* Remember non-keyboard users when building things
