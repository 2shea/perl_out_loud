So... Why.

???
- pause - 
You've seen some tech today that you probably aren't familiar with, and maybe it's interesting or novel. But I would be doing a disservice if I didn't remind folks the impact that technology such as this can have for folks like myself who were otherwise potentially looking at a career ending (or most certainly career limiting) injuries or othwerwise unable to use a keyboard or mouse.

After about a year of a very unsustainable, painful, stressful, work and personal life (because remember i still have symptoms when i'm not working). At its worst, the pain and discomfort was so bad that I couldn't sit through a meal at a restaurant, or I would skip social gatherings because I wouldn't be able to focus. I wouldn't travel because I couldn't find comfort riding in a car or plane. I often had to lay on the floor just to be somewhat comfortable. This is all the very personal things I'm sharing, but I feel like it's important to shed light on the real human impact of this tech. I remember first day that I was able to stop working when I wanted to and not because of pain, and that felt like such a wonderful treat. This technology has given me access when I felt like the door was closing. This is why I'm using voice.

As a cool side benefit, I get to stand here today with all you folks to show off how cool it is to talk to a computer.

## Take Aways
* Take care of your body!
* People are using speech to code in real life
* Consider _all_ users when building/designing
* The future may be more diverse than the keyboard/mouse model

???
- take care of your body (and appreciate what it can do, while you're at it!)
- ask for ergo evaluations
- people are using voice to write code - this is happening now.
- remember your non-keyboard users when you build things, don't make the pad sanda sad.
- the future may be more diverse than the keyboard/mouse model. many of the folks who are currently taking advantage of this tech do so because of an injury or physical limitation, but I think we are well on our way to a future where the keyboard and mouse are not the input methods. already we are seeing the rise in voice assistants (siri, alexa), and some exciting new companies popping up with wearables that read signals in your nervous system to control a computer. We've been relying heavily on touch control, but maybe it's time we question and challenge it's limitations.
