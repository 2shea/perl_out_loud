* New keyboards only got me so far
* Got frustrated feeling limited

While taking four aleve a day, using a very specialized keyboard, adding a left-hand mouse, maintaining a stretching schedule, i could type ~3 hours a day with no more than ~30-45 straight minutes of typing, but broken up with long breaks in between.

* Started looking at voice dictation
