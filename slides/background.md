Show you what that looks like
Simple web server written in Rust
You will see:  pressing letter keys, words, formatting words in various ways, navigating around the code, switching to the terminal, using a browser, using git
Intentionally left some errors to demonstrate fixing on the fly

Reflection
???
Now that it's been a few years, a few takeaways from my experience.
---

Chronic injuries are difficult to heal. There is no "quick fix".
???
The longer it took to get the injury, the longer to heal.
Typing budget
Manage your budget hours like a resource.

Disability can be fluid.

Hybrid
Disability can come and go; can happen to anyone at anytime.

Voice Coding today is even better! Still a steep learning curve.
???
- New speech engine; better recognition. fancy microphone isnt as necessary.
- More built out libraries
- Community has grown; still vibrant
- Awareness of voice coding
- Not the first tool I'd reach for if you're experiencing limitations, but it's a career-saver for many having long term limitations

I had no reason to think I was going to be in this situation.
???
Can't plan for things like this. In 2019, we had different concerns that we have now.
Life is full of surprises.
It could be you?
Lots of people out there struggle with discomfort, temporary situations

Many accessibility features that were good for me were also good for others!
???
Might think you are designing for certain profile of users, but you may end up making things better for everyone.
e.g., Copy to Clipboard buttons
Semantic html also good for keyboard users
Sites designed with good tab flow good for screen readers

Getting accessibility issues addressed is really time consuming and difficult to get prioritized.
???
hard to get work prioritized when it's seen as impacting only a few users.
Accessibility needs to be a regular practice in your development cycles; not an after thought. Not an add on.
---

Sometimes the solutions are fancy; sometimes they are simple.
???
- Use semantic html!
- Some features not necessarily considered as "accessible" were really helpful, e.g., copy buttons are a delight

Design the world that would include you if you find yourself someday limited by your body.
???
TODO:  does this sound like I'm excluding people who currently have disablities?
Lingering Frustrations
- Developer tools were some of the least accessible
- Much better luck if accessibility is considered early on
- Biggest issue for me by far was web pages not using semantic html (e.g., using div/span instead of button/link).

Call to Action
- Especially post 2020, the digital experience is incredibly important in maintaining access for many folks.
- Builders (e.g., designers, software engineers) have the ability to make a difference.
- Voice coding was pivotal in untangling my health and work - no longer had to choose between the two
