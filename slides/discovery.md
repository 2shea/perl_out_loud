## What Is Talon?

Software that allows you to use hands free input to interact with your computer
it's very new (2018), and currently only mac
* (voice/noise commands, eye tracking)
free, but patreon support

This talk is not about Talon... it's an example of how Talon can be used. All 
the commands and tools you will see are built on top of Talon's API.
* Mention what dragon is
* Also has a built-in voice engine
