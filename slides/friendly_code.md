## Voice Dictation Friendly Code
* Use abbreviations/acronyms thoughtfully
* Don't try to save vowels
  * \`backspace\` not \`bkspc\`
* shorter files are better

???
- Surprisingly not that much I've run into, but a few things that I think are good practice anyway:
- use full words when you can (don't make it about english only)
- also benefits screen readers
- don't unnecessarily shorten words, like removing vowels. You aren't saving that much, you risk someone later not knowing what it means, and it's more difficult for voice/screen reader users.
- I navigate by line number. Longer files means I have to say longer numbers. It's generally good to avoid long files anyway.
