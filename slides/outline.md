Intro - who am I?
Background
  - My experience with RSI
  - How I arrived at Voice Coding
Voice Coding Demo (3min recorded video, yes it includes the popular 'whale quench' command for exiting vim)
  - Will give a nod to longer talks out there for folks who want to see longer demos
Reflecting on my Experience (now that I'm a few more years out)
  - Voice Coding works quite well, however it's still a steep learning curve. Will cover some advancements in the tech if I have time.
  - Disability can be fluid/dynamic for some (like myself)
  - Many accessibility features that were good for me, were also good for others
  - Many accessibility features have simple, known solutions, e.g., use semantic html
  - Some features not necessarily considered as "accessible" were really helpful, e.g., copy buttons are a delight
  - Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought or an add-on
Close with Call to Action
 - I'm still working on the exact framing and how it will tie in with the rest of the talk, but it will be an ask of the audience to keep accessibility top of mind when making decisions around building technology. Build the world that would include them if they ever find themselves, like me, limited in some way by their body.
