## Not So Big Challenges

* Supporting specific programming languages
* Building tools with Talon

???
- language optimizations are nice to have, quality of life improvements but not necessarily required
- Talon's API has been easy to work with. I can make new tools on the fly. Once I save a file, it's live. I often am iterating on my tools as I work. I can even build bigger tools, like render webview helpers. It's pretty powerful, and I'm only scratching the surface.
